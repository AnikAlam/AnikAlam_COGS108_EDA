    "Our research question is: What is the economic impact of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour stops in North America between March 2023 to August 2023 on the local economics of different cities? How do factors (such as venue size, average ticket price, concert attendance, etc.) impact inflation in sectors such as retail, hospitality, and the restaurant industry?"

     "In 2023, singer Taylor Swift embarked on a tour of her greatest hit songs, aptly titled “The Eras Tour”. The tour spanned 53 stops throughout the United States, beginning in March and ending in August. Swift then continued touring in Latin America, Asia, and Australia into 2024, with plans to continue touring Europe and the remaining North American stops till the end of 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift has been praised for helping boost the tourism industry at the various cities she visited on her United States tour. As fans flocked to city centers to witness her performance, they expended savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism and hospitality prior to the big event. In what is dubbed as “Swiftonomics<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1),” the economic implications of the Eras Tour fascinated economists as they gathered data to understand these statistics. States reported receiving millions towards their economies, with metropolitans, such as Los Angeles, also seeing an increase in thousands of jobs to meet the demand. However, with the increased willingness to spend on tourism, there was also record inflation in certain sectors, as the prices of transportation and lodging shot up, with dwindling supply attempting to match significant demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies that have been done on this topic primarily consist of new articles which report increases in spending when Swift visits these cities. For example, this study<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) states that the Eras Tour added 5 billion dollars to the economy. Other research works<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) examine the use of the words “Taylor Swift” as a marketing tool, whether or not the singer even stops in the city. For example, in San Diego, a sushi restaurant hosted a Swift-themed night the same week the singer was in Los Angeles, and immediately sold out. According to another study<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4), of the 53 stops in 20 cities, the average fan spent nearly $1300 on travel, hotel stays, food, and merchandise. In Pittsburgh, average room rates saw a 106% increase, with 83% of guests coming from outside the host county. We have not seen a comprehensive city-by-city analysis, and are curious as to which cities saw the greatest boosts in revenue, which sectors are most crucial to economic success, and if ticket pricing and number sold come into contention. With such a variety in demographics and areas visited, our group is interested in analyzing which areas saw the greatest growth in revenue, and where inflation hurt consumers the most.\n",

    "- We hypothesize that North American stops on Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour” will cause local economies to see a sharp spike in prices due to inflation, particularly within hotels, transportation, food, and other hospitality-based sectors.\n",
    "- Due to Taylor Swift’s popularity, cultural impact, and massive fanbase, we expect that businesses in the hospitality sector in cities on the tour route will increase their pricing for services/accommodations accordingly in order to maximize profits, given that a large influx of tourists will naturally increase the demand and congestion of services.\n"

    "### Description of Datasets:\n",
    "Due to the nature of our focus for this project, we chose these datasets to see if we can locate and define any changes in local economy and business prices around the dates of the Taylor Swift concert. In order to complete our analysis, we combined data from various sources to create a new dataset for our specific question. These were compiled using a variety of sources such as the Federal Bureau of Labor statistics for economic variables, hotel hospitality from local newspapers of each respective town, stadium sizes along with tour dates and ticket prices from wikipedia, and more.\n",
    "The metrics include the number of attendees and revenue in dollars, which can serve as proxies for the economic impact of the concerts. Data types include dates, categorical variables, and numerical variables. Additionally, specific components such as food price increases and leisure and hospitality gains in order to determine the inflation noted by the influence of the tour. We also used Consumer Price Index (CPI) to gauge the inflation at the time by comparing the current and previous year’s market basket price for an overall inflation rate. Thus, comparing the hospitality prices before and after the Taylor Swift Eras Tour using the Reputation Tour forms the data set for our analysis.\n",

However, the datasets we are choosing to utilize contain no personally identifiable information, so there are limited consequences for privacy and confidentiality. There should also be ethical consideration given to the long-term consequences of analyzing and sharing our results to the public, as it may influence others’ public perceptions of Taylor Swift and the Eras Tour, potentially affecting advertising and investment decisions. This may also have ethical implications surrounding the effect on hotels and small businesses/restaurants whose finances we would analyze as part of the local economies of each city, or the disruption to daily lives that local residents face. Thus, we must ensure that the data we collect is accurate and transparent in its collection, so that biases do not lead to inaccurate conclusions that harm the well-being of businesses and communities.\n"
